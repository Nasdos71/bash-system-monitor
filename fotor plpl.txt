1-Report generator from logs
    Parse monitor.log and generate an HTML report with:
        Charts/graphs (CPU/RAM over time)
        Summary statistics (avg, min, max, peaks)
        Timeline visualization
    Use gnuplot or simple ASCII art charts, or generate HTML with embedded JavaScript charts

2-rocess management
    Kill processes (with confirmation)
    Change priority (nice/renice)
    Show process tree hierarchy (pstree-style)
    Filter by user, CPU threshold, memory threshold

3-Network connections & services
    Show active connections (ss/netstat)
    List listening ports and associated processes
    Show systemd service status (running/failed)
    Network bandwidth per connection

4-Historical trends & analysis
    Compare current vs previous snapshot
    Show trends: "CPU usage increased 20% in last 5 minutes"
    Peak detection: "Memory peaked at 95% at 14:32"
    Simple predictions: "At current rate, disk will fill in X days"

5-System health score
    Calculate an overall health score (0-100) based on:
    CPU load
    Memory pressure
    Disk space
    Temperature warnings
    Color-coded status (green/yellow/red)

6-Export & data formats
    Export current snapshot to CSV/JSON
    Export log data to CSV for Excel analysis
    Generate a summary PDF (using enscript or similar)
